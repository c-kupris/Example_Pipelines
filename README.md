This repository contains some different examples of analysis pipelines with ways you can interrogate genetic data, and insights you can gain from them. 

One file, "Trajectory Analysis using 10x Single Cell Gene Expression Data" uses 10x genonmics to interrogate white blood cells and visualize cell fates. 
This has implications for cancer therapies, particularly blood cancers.

The other, "Example Data Analysis Pipeline", extracts data from a VCF file that can be found [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axU8m235RIevvhaxUIRPeToIlcdxs3Dg/view?usp=sharing](here) 
and gives descriptive statistics and plots.
